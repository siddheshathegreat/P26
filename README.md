White Sauce Pasta is an easy-to-make recipe of cooked pasta in a delicious white sauce – also known as Béchamel sauce. Simply prepare the white sauce – a mixture of butter, milk, flour and spices and pour it over your cooked pasta.

This popular dish is vegetarian and can be served as a snack or light dinner. Make it more hearty and nutritious by adding some mixed vegetables.

When preparing pasta recipes, whole wheat pasta is always a great healthy choice. I have used whole wheat penne in this recipe, however, you can use any pasta you prefer, including different varieties like macaroni, rigatoni or farfalle.

Adding mixed veggies to this classic pasta dish is a great way to have your family some veggies along with their pasta. These vegetables can be steamed, cooked, sautéed or roasted.
